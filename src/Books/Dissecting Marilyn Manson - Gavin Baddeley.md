description: In Dissecting Marilyn Manson, author Gavin Baddeley performs a cultural autopsy upon Manson, examining the seminal influences and psychotic sources that have gone into making him the Frankenstein monster that he is today. With its heavily visual approach, the text and pictures create the impression of a pathological scrapbook, emphasising the idea of the performer being put under the knife, exploring the Manson mythos in an irreverent but authoritative manner. Each chapter exposes one gruesome angle after another, gradually revealing just what makes Marilyn Manson tick and why so many find him so compelling. Dissecting Marilyn Manson offers the legion of dedicated Manson fans an alternative look into his macabre and twisted world. This revised and updated edition continues dissecting up to the present day, analysing recent developments in Manson's professional and private life, including his recent high-profile court case, marriage to fetish model Dita Von Teese, and creative forays into the worlds of art and film.
