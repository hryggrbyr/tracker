description: "An unforgettable YA debut by Jamison Shea. Ace of Spades meets House of Hollow in a thrilling horror novel about the toll of giving everything to a world that will never love you back. Laure Mesny is determined to make it in the cut-throat world of ballet, and she will do anything to prove that this Black girl can take centre stage. Anything . . . Even if it means entering into a bargain with a primordial power in the Catacombs beneath Paris. Laure is promised influence and adoration - and she gets it. But that alone is not enough, not for the cruel and privileged people who surround her. Her climb to stardom leaves broken bodies in her wake, some of which aren't her doing. As she finds herself deep within this monstrous world, she is faced with the ultimate choice: will she retreat or succumb to the darkness forever? THERE WILL BE BLOOD."
