description: "Lydia Crow is back. After the turbulent events of The Magpie Key, Lydia is trying to adjust to life without her home. She is living in Uncle Charlie’s house and learning what ‘head of the Crow Family’ truly means. The four magical Families of London are playing nicely… for now, but a new threat has risen. Lydia and DCI Fleet race against time to find a modern-day Jack the Ripper stalking the streets of Whitechapel. But all is not as it seems… The unmissable ninth instalment in the bestselling Urban Fantasy mystery series, Crow Investigations. Praise for the series: 'I'm a huge fan!' Charlaine Harris, award winning and bestselling author of mystery and fantasy ‘My favourite new urban fantasy series, clever and twisty and deliciously magical, with a shivery sense of wonder that feels utterly grounded in its London setting. Perfect for fans of Ben Aaronovitch, Genevieve Cogman or Robert Galbraith!’ Stephanie Burgis, author of Snowspelled 'I raced through this book, it's thrilling, fast paced and full of adventure and intriguing characters. I cannot wait to read more about Lydia so I'm delighted that this will be a series and that there will be more stories about the Crow family. The Night Raven is perfect for fans of Anna McKerrow, Laura Laakso, Ben Aaronovitch and V. E. Schwab.' LisaReadsBooks 'All my favourite things together - mystery, crime, a sassy female PI and a Magical underworld going on right under Londoner's noses.' A.L. Michael"
