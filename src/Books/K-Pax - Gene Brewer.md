description: "Prot has just been admitted to one of New York City's mental institutions. The reason is entirely justified: he claims to be an alien from the planet K-Pax, a planet where harmony reigns. This is his only peculiar trait, since otherwise Prot is a sane, intelligent person with pleasant manners. Patients, orderlies, and doctors are delighted with his presence. So much so that even the specialists have begun to have doubts... What if K-Pax existed somewhere in the universe? What if Prot could show us the way?"

Prot has just been admitted to one of New York City's mental institutions. The reason is entirely justified: he claims to be an alien from the planet K-Pax, a planet where harmony reigns. This is his only peculiar trait, since otherwise Prot is a sane, intelligent person with pleasant manners. Patients, orderlies, and doctors are delighted with his presence. So much so that even the specialists have begun to have doubts... What if K-Pax existed somewhere in the universe? What if Prot could show us the way?
