description: "UNLEASH THE MAGIC: Discover this fierce, witchy retelling of Irish mythology from an unforgettable new voice in mythic fiction Perfect for fans of Elodie Harper’s The Wolf Den, Rosie Hewlett’s Medea and Costanza Casati’s Clytemnestra -- RULER. MOTHER. GODDESS. WARRIOR. They called me The Morrigan. I was magnificent. I was multitudes. They twisted my story, stripped me away. But I will tell it now in my own voice. It begins, as all the best stories do, in darkness. From an ancient, storm-tossed sea, a tribe of gods reach the rocky shores of Ireland. Among them, a strange, hungry, red-haired girl. A girl who can change shape, from bird to beast to goddess. A girl who dreams of battle, of blood, of death and power. She does not know yet that a woman who seeks to rule will always be in danger – or that there are far more treacherous figures in this land than the gods who raised her. She does not know that one day love will burn so deep in her heart that its scars will never heal. That she will know pain so raw and pure it will almost tear her apart. She does not know that her journey will take a thousand years. That her name will be remembered for a thousand more. She is The Morrigan, and she is waiting: a girl with rage coiled in her chest. Beautiful, powerful, ravenous rage. A rage that will live forever. An electric debut retelling of Ireland’s mythic goddess of war, from a bold and powerful new voice. -- AUTHORS ARE ENCHANTED BY THE MORRIGAN 'Curran's The Morrigan will do for Irish mythology what Madeline Miller did for Greek...An absolute triumph' Amy McCulloch 'Thrilling and bloody from first page to last, this is an extraordinary portrait of a goddess, a warrior, a woman. Welcome to a stunning new voice in literary fiction' Patrick Ness, author of A Monster Calls 'The Morrigan may be the most powerful book you will read this year' Lucy Holland, author of Sistersong and Song of the Huntress 'A fearless and ferocious retelling that does great justice to the original stories, effortlessly navigating an epic scale with heartbreaking intimacy. Kim Curran is an astonishing talent' Kate Heartfield, author of The Valkyrie and The Embroidered Book 'Transported back to ancient Ireland, The Morrigan took me on a breathtaking journey brimming with fury and longing. Captivated from start to finish, I dreamed of the Morrigan and her lust for vengeance long after I read the last page. Stunning!' Anya Bergman, author of The Witches of Vardø 'Breathtaking in scope, blistering in truth, The Morrigan is a beautifully dark tale of rage, power and love. Razor-sharp, profound and intensely moving, this is more than a retelling.I adored it!' Miranda Dickinson 'Like Madeline Miller, Curran has taken centuries of Irish legend and harnessed a powerful retelling for modern readers. A timely feminist battle cry with pitch perfect writing' Juno Dawson"
