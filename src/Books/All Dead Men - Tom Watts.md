“They’re not staying dead…”

As the army battles infected and the outbreak’s dark origins emerge, James faces a choice: can he set aside his bitterness to save his family? Or will the secrets hunting him prove more deadly than the undead?Fans of relentless, pulse-pounding horror won’t want to miss All Dead Men – a gripping fight for survival in the heart of terror.
