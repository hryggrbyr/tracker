James’ life came crashing down, when he found out his wife and brother were having an affair. Desperate to heal his wounds, he returned to the Lake District to rebuild his broken family. But, when his sister’s terrified voice crackles through a desperate phone call, his plans shatter:

“They’re not staying dead…”

A deadly virus is sweeping through the picturesque villages, turning his neighbours into bloodthirsty monsters. Now, James must team up with the one person he swore never to trust – his brother, a haunted ex-soldier – to rescue their sister from the spreading chaos.

As the army battles infected and the outbreak’s dark origins emerge, James faces a choice: can he set aside his bitterness to save his family? Or will the secrets hunting him prove more deadly than the undead?Fans of relentless, pulse-pounding horror won’t want to miss All Dead Men – a gripping fight for survival in the heart of terror.
