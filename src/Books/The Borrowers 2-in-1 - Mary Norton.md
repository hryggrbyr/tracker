description: "Deep beneath the floorboards lives the tiny Borrower family - Pod, Homily and Arrietty Clock. Everything they have is borrowed from the humans above them, even their names are not quite their own. There is just one rule: they must never be seen. Then one day Arrietty meets the boy, and the family's incredible adventure begins. A great value edition of the first two classic BORROWERS books to tie in with this year's BBC 90-minute family Christmas special."
