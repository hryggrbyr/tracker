# Parks and Recreation (2009)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/dDuzrl9rUIBYieZjqmtNCdncrmZ.jpg)

In an attempt to beautify her town — and advance her career — Leslie Knope, a mid-level bureaucrat in the Parks and Recreation Department of Pawnee, Indiana, takes on bureaucrats, cranky neighbors, and single-issue fanatics whose weapons are lawsuits, the jumble of city codes, and the democratic process she loves so much.
