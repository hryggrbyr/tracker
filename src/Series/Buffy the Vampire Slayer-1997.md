# Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/y7fVZkyheCEQHDUEHwNmYENGfT2.jpg)

Into every generation a slayer is born: one girl in all the world, a chosen one. She alone will wield the strength and skill to fight the vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness; to stop the spread of their evil and the swell of their number. She is the Slayer.
