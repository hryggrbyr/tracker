# The Secret of Crickley Hall (2012)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/a0WKfSZavXH1XUMh3MxKkRFVuHo.jpg)

A year after the disappearance of their son, Gabe and Eve Caleigh and their two daughters attempt to start anew, they head to Crickley Hall - a seemingly perfect countryside house. But when cellar doors start to open on their own, phantom children's cries are heard through the night and a frenzied cane-wielding specter rears its head - the Caleigh's realize the house comes with a lot more than they bargained for. Just as they're ready to move out, Eve Caleigh hears Cam's cries and all bets are off.
