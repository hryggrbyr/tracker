# Married at First Sight (2015)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/2F0ADv2beVB4tRG0qx7YlWMvnDN.jpg)

Working with leading relationship experts, eight Australian singles are carefully match-made into four married couples, who each meet each other - for the very first time - at their wedding. We'll follow them as they marry, honeymoon, meet the in-laws and set up home, all the while getting to know one another more and more deeply, to see if the matchmakers have got it right and they will have a future together.
