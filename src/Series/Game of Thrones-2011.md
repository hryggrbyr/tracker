# Game of Thrones (2011)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/1XS1oqL89opfnbLl8WnZY1O1uJx.jpg)

Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Friction between the houses leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond.
