![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wRs2y3xWjdGhaNMo71PqxUvW26.jpg)

University lecturer Dr Leah Dale has always prided herself on her academic integrity so when final year student Rose, submits a suspiciously top-grade essay, Leah is quick to call her out. But thereâ€™s more going on than meets the eye as Rose takes the challenge as a personal affront, and what begins as a seemingly open and shut case of academic deception soon spirals out of control.
