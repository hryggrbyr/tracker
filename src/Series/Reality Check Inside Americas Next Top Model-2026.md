# Reality Check: Inside America's Next Top Model (2026)

Models, judges and "ANTM" insiders — including Tyra Banks — look back at the reality show's complicated legacy in this eye-opening documentary series. The glamorous modeling competition became a pop-culture phenomenon marked by explosive drama, meltdowns, and controversies that remain viral today. Through candid interviews with former contestants, winners, and judges, the three-part series unpacks the behind-the-scenes reality of a show that attracted over 100 million viewers at its peak while revealing troubling patterns of exploitation, body shaming, and questionable production choices that continue to spark debate decades later.
