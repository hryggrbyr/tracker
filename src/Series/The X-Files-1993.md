# The X-Files (1993)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/rcBx0p8h51LHceyhquYMxbspJQu.jpg)

The exploits of FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who investigate X-Files: marginalized, unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. Mulder believes in the existence of aliens and the paranormal while Scully, a skeptic, is assigned to make scientific analyses of Mulder's discoveries that debunk Mulder's work and thus return him to mainstream cases.
