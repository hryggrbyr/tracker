# Three Girls (2017)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5qqXN4XGwJXESUlRvqaYiy17rMy.jpg)

The story of three of the children who were victims in the 2012 grooming and sex trafficking case in Rochdale, for which nine men were convicted and sentenced. The drama explores how these girls were groomed, how they were ignored by the authorities directly responsible for protecting them, and how they eventually made themselves heard.
