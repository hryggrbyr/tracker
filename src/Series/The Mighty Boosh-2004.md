![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/dKlYEo7mc1XLN2PutYlRuTLUXlC.jpg)

A British comic fantasy containing humour and pop-culture references.  Episodes often featured elaborate musical numbers in different genres, such as electro, heavy metal, funk, and rap. The show has been known for popularising a style called "crimping"; short acappella songs which are present throughout all three series.
