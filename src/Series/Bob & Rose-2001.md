![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/lzAYvLfe2KdLtlb0QE5t2Ho8p0C.jpg)

Bob Gossage is a thirtysomething teacher who has been gay all his life.  Now, however, he quite unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with a woman, Rose Cooper. Various confusions and misunderstandings ensue, with Rose's heartbroken ex-boyfriend Andy, Bob's jealous colleague Holly, and his gay-rights campaigning mother Monica all getting caught up in the mix.
