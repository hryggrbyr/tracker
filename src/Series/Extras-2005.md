# Extras (2005)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/oxiA2O4wRBCOzvfxYjNKZQuitQc.jpg)

Andy Millman gave up his day job five years ago in the hope of achieving the big time, but heâ€™s yet to land a speaking part, let alone saunter down the red carpet to pick up an Oscar. He remains optimistic however, as rubbing shoulders with the A-list on-set only serves to reinforce his belief that the big time is just a job or two away.
