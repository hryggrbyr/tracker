# Yellowjackets (2021)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/xRnGrn7Z7SC0KIBodocoU1QgDZF.jpg)

This equal parts survival epic, psychological horror story and coming-of-age drama tells the saga of a team of wildly talented high school girls soccer players who become the (un)lucky survivors of a plane crash deep in the remote northern wilderness. The series chronicles their descent from a complicated but thriving team to savage clans, while also tracking the lives they’ve attempted to piece back together nearly 25 years later.
