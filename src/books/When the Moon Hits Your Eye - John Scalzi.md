description: "One day, suddenly and without explanation, the moon turns into a ball of cheese. For some, it’s an opportunity. For others, it’s time to question their life choices. How can the world stay the same in the face of such absurdity and uncertainty? Astronauts and billionaires, comedians and bank executives, professors and presidents, teenagers and patients at the end of their lives – over the length of a lunar cycle, each gets their moment in the moonlight. To panic, to plan, to wonder and to hope, to laugh and to grieve. All in a story that goes all the places you’d expect, and to many others you could never anticipate. For the people of the earth, this could be the end – or the beginning of a whole new world. From the Hugo and Locus Award-winning author John Scalzi, When the Moon Hits Your Eye is an entirely serious take on an entirely unserious subject. * * * Praise for When the Moon Hits Your Eye: ‘Very funny and occasionally moving, this is a welcome bit of comic relief’ - The Guardian ‘Funny, emotional, thought-provoking and scary’ - SFX Magazine"
