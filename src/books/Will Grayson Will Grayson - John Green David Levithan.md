description: The New York Times bestselling novel from John Green, the author of multi-million bestseller The Fault in Our Stars, and David Levithan. One cold night, in a most unlikely corner of Chicago, Will Grayson crosses paths with . . . Will Grayson. Two guys with the same name, running in two very different circles, suddenly find their lives going in new and unexpected directions, and culminating in epic turns-of-heart and the most fabulous musical ever to grace the high-school stage. Told in alternating voices from two award-winning authors - John Green (author of The Fault in Our Stars) and David Levithan (author of Boy Meets Boy) - this unique collaborative novel features a double helping of the heart and humour that has won both authors legions of fans. 'Funny, rude and original' - New York Times Book Review 'Will have readers simultaneously laughing, crying and singing at the top of their lungs' - Kirkus Reviews 'This novel has serious buzz' - Entertainment Weekly
