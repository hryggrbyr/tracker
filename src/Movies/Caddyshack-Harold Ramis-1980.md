# Caddyshack (1980)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/lXnNz7zOXCsftMDVoU3VSo0Eioi.jpg)

At an exclusive country club, an ambitious young caddy, Danny Noonan, eagerly pursues a caddy scholarship in hopes of attending college and, in turn, avoiding a job at the lumber yard. In order to succeed, he must first win the favour of the elitist Judge Smails, and then the caddy golf tournament which Smails sponsors.
