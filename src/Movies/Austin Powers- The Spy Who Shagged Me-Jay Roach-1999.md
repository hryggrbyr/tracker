# Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wqcE8EAmVl5j3mLuIrHFG7RmQyg.jpg)

When diabolical genius Dr. Evil travels back in time to steal superspy Austin Powers's ‘mojo,’ Austin must return to the swingin' '60s himself - with the help of American agent, Felicity Shagwell - to stop the dastardly plan. Once there, Austin faces off against Dr. Evil's army of minions to try to save the world in his own unbelievably groovy way.
