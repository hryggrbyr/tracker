# Apocalypse Now (1979)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/gQB8Y5RCMkv2zwzFHbUJX3kAhvA.jpg)

At the height of the Vietnam war, Captain Benjamin Willard is sent on a dangerous mission that, officially, "does not exist, nor will it ever exist." His goal is to locate - and eliminate - a mysterious Green Beret Colonel named Walter Kurtz, who has been leading his personal army on illegal guerrilla missions into enemy territory.
