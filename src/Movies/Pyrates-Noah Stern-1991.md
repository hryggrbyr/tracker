# Pyrates (1991)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/gPrC6AVW9egAoLCmtFP3h9kXIgU.jpg)

As soon as they meet Ari and Sam get into a pretty passionate - and combustible - relationship. Indeed, the scenes of their rendezvous often seem reminiscent of the Chicago Fire. But the course of true flaming lust never runs true, and as they try to handle their all-consuming passion their two best friends endlessly meet to compare notes on developments.
