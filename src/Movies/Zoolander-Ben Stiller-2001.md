# Zoolander (2001)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/1IOLMlNKSoo3FToVGYV1PjE3ehn.jpg)

Clear the runway for Derek Zoolander, VH1's three-time male model of the year. His face falls when hippie-chic Hansel scooters in to steal this year's award. The evil fashion guru Mugatu seizes the opportunity to turn Derek into a killing machine. It's a well-designed conspiracy and only with the help of Hansel and a few well-chosen accessories like Matilda can Derek make the world safe for male models everywhere.
