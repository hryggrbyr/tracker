# Miss Congeniality (2000)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/pat3vKaRlB70he4ghwTMydR4TvP.jpg)

When the local FBI office receives a letter from a terrorist known only as 'The Citizen', it's quickly determined that he's planning his next act at the Miss America beauty pageant. Because tough-as-nails Gracie Hart is the only female Agent at the office, she's chosen to go undercover as the contestant from New Jersey.
