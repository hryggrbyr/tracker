# Pulp Fiction (1994)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/vQWk5YBFWF4bZaofAbv0tShwBvQ.jpg)

A burger-loving hit man, his philosophical partner, a drug-addled gangster's moll and a washed-up boxer converge in this sprawling, comedic crime caper. Their adventures unfurl in three stories that ingeniously trip back and forth in time.
