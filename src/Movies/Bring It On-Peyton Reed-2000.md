# Bring It On (2000)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/bnVby0qI0dS7YunbShP7mw68HY3.jpg)

The Toro cheerleading squad from Rancho Carne High School in San Diego has got spirit, spunk, sass and a killer routine that's sure to land them the national championship trophy for the sixth year in a row. But for newly-elected team captain Torrance, the Toros' road to total cheer glory takes a shady turn when she discovers that their perfectly-choreographed routines were in fact stolen.
