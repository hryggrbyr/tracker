# Clerks (1994)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9IiSgiq4h4siTIS9H3o4nZ3h5L9.jpg)

Convenience and video store clerks Dante and Randal are sharp-witted, potty-mouthed and bored out of their minds. So in between needling customers, the counter jockeys play hockey on the roof, visit a funeral home and deal with their love lives.
