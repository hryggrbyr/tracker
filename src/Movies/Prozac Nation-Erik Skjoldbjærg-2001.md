# Prozac Nation (2001)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/4QB1h6mxlmQVM8BtYMybTwL2foc.jpg)

When talented young writer Elizabeth Wurtzel earns a scholarship to Harvard, she sees it as her chance to escape the pressures of her working-class background and concentrate on her true talent. But what starts out so promising leads to self-destructive behavior and paralyzing depression that reflects an entire generation's struggle to navigate the effects of divorce, drugs, sex, and high expectations.
