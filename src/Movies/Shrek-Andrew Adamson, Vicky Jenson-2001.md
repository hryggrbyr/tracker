# Shrek (2001)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/iB64vpL3dIObOtMZgX3RqdVdQDc.jpg)

It ain't easy bein' green -- especially if you're a likable (albeit smelly) ogre named Shrek. On a mission to retrieve a gorgeous princess from the clutches of a fire-breathing dragon, Shrek teams up with an unlikely compatriot -- a wisecracking donkey.
