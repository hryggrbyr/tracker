# The Woman in the Wall (2023)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/tnqCuFq0RNBCdI8Tl3nFD0WLlis.jpg)

When Lorna Brady, a survivor of one of Ireland's Magdalene Laundries, wakes to find a corpse in her house, she has no idea who the dead woman is or if she's responsible for the apparent murder, because she has long suffered from extreme bouts of sleepwalking.
