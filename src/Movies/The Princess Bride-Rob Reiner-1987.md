# The Princess Bride (1987)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/dvjqlp2sAhUeFjUOfQDgqwpphHj.jpg)

In this enchantingly cracked fairy tale, the beautiful Princess Buttercup and the dashing Westley must overcome staggering odds to find happiness amid six-fingered swordsmen, murderous princes, Sicilians and rodents of unusual size. But even death can't stop these true lovebirds from triumphing.
