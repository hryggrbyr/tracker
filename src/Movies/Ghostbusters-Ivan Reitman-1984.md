# Ghostbusters (1984)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/7E8nLijS9AwwUEPu2oFYOVKhdFA.jpg)

After losing their academic posts at a prestigious university, a team of parapsychologists goes into business as proton-pack-toting "ghostbusters" who exterminate ghouls, hobgoblins and supernatural pests of all stripes. An ad campaign pays off when a knockout cellist hires the squad to purge her swanky digs of demons that appear to be living in her refrigerator.
