# Attack of the Adult Babies (2017)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/vg3EQp0ZvUNMXgSRrNynZMAsBmz.jpg)

A group of high-powered, middle-aged white men go to this place to take refuge from the stresses of their daily lives and spend time relaxing and regressing as “adult babies.” It’s set in a beautiful, secret location but this is not their only function. As adult babies, they are there to refuel the world’s economy by sinister and unusual means.
