# Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/auPOq1wgZuYSaADejOskBKG6fuV.jpg)

Confined to a mental hospital, young Kirsty Cotton insists her supposedly dead father is stuck in hell, controlled by sadomasochistic demons after being betrayed by his evil, occult-obsessed wife, Julia. Few believe Kirsty, except the thrill-seeking Dr. Channard, who is intrigued by the young woman's lurid stories. So when Kirsty and fellow patient Tiffany head to hell for a rescue, Channard and Julia are close behind.
