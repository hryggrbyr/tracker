When Sarah is forced to babysit her half-brother Toby, she inadvertently summons the Goblin King and he whisks Toby away to his castle at the centre of a labyrinth. Sarah enters into a bargain with the Goblin King where she is given just thirteen hours to solve the labyrinth and rescue Toby, or else lose him forever.
