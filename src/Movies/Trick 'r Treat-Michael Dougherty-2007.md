# Trick 'r Treat (2007)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/w0nmol4g7n6MFfhfphV7GzHHYjB.jpg)

Four interwoven stories that occur on Halloween: an everyday high school principal has a secret life as a serial killer; a college virgin might have just met the one guy for her; a group of teenagers pull a mean prank, and a bitter old recluse receives an uninvited guest.
