# Days of Thunder (1990)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/2xfP227oLToQjBCUg3FI18pWh3G.jpg)

Talented but unproven stock car driver Cole Trickle gets a break and with the guidance of veteran Harry Hogge turns heads on the track. The young hotshot develops a rivalry with a fellow racer that threatens his career when the two smash their cars. But with the help of his doctor, Cole just might overcome his injuries-- and his fear.
