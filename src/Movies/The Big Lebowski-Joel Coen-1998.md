# The Big Lebowski (1998)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9mprbw31MGdd66LR0AQKoDMoFRv.jpg)

Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker who only wants to bowl and drink White Russians, is mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski, a wheelchair-bound millionaire, and finds himself dragged into a strange series of events involving nihilists, adult film producers, ferrets, errant toes, and large sums of money.
