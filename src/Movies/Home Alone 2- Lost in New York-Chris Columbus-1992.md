Instead of flying to Florida with his folks, Kevin ends up alone in New York, where he gets a hotel room with his dad's credit cardâ€”despite problems from a clerk and meddling bellboy. But when Kevin runs into his old nemeses, the Wet Bandits, he's determined to foil their plans to rob a toy store on Christmas Eve.
