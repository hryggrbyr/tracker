# The House with a Clock in Its Walls (2018)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qM66Hv4ByAxnilr0jaqCA9uOD4Y.jpg)

When ten-year-old Lewis is suddenly orphaned, he is sent to live with his Uncle Jonathan in a creaky (and creepy) old mansion with a mysterious ticking noise that emanates from the walls. Upon discovering that his uncle is a warlock, Lewis begins learning magic, but when he rebelliously resurrects an evil warlock he must find the secret of the house and save the world from destruction.
