# Citizen Kane (1941)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/sav0jxhqiH0bPr2vZFU0Kjt2nZL.jpg)

Newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane is taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. As a result, every well-meaning, tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event.
