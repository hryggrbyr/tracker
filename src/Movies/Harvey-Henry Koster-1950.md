# Harvey (1950)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/dgd82hYmpiXDM1G867HqNaWe8wj.jpg)

The story of Elwood P. Dowd who makes friends with a spirit taking the form of a human-sized rabbit named Harvey that only he sees (and a few privileged others on occasion also.) After his sister tries to commit him to a mental institution, a comedy of errors ensues. Elwood and Harvey become the catalysts for a family mending its wounds and for romance blossoming in unexpected places.
