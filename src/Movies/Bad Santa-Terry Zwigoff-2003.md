# Bad Santa (2003)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/rfClLIyeHqpMofmrPY8DaLe4z9x.jpg)

You'd better watch out - Santa Claus Willie T. Soke is coming to town, and he doesn't care if you've been naughty or nice. Wille's favorite holiday tradition is to fill his sacks with loot lifted from shopping malls across the country. But this year his plot gets derailed by a wisecracking store detective, a sexy bartender, and a kid who's convinced Willie is the real Santa Claus.
