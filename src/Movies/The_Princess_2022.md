# The Princess (2022)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9pCoqX24a6rE981fY1O3PmhiwrB.jpg)

A beautiful, strong-willed young royal refuses to wed the cruel sociopath to whom she is betrothed and is kidnapped and locked in a remote tower of her father’s castle. With her scorned, vindictive suitor intent on taking her father’s throne, the princess must protect her family and save the kingdom.
