# Knowing (2009)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/OG0mxQt4YaNIWiz8EKJSHe9lPh.jpg)

A teacher opens a time capsule that has been dug up at his son's elementary school; in it are some chilling predictions -- some that have already occurred and others that are about to -- that lead him to believe his family plays a role in the events that are about to unfold.
