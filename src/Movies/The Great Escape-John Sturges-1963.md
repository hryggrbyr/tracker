# The Great Escape (1963)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/gBH4H8UMFxl139HaLz6lRuvsel8.jpg)

The Nazis, exasperated at the number of escapes from their prison camps by a relatively small number of Allied prisoners, relocate them to a high-security 'escape-proof' camp to sit out the remainder of the war. Undaunted, the prisoners plan one of the most ambitious escape attempts of World War II. Based on a true story.
