![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/sd3qUIv5uoP2oTbqv66CzXSPjKG.jpg)

Cocky researcher Sebastian Caine is working on a project to make living creatures invisible. Determined to achieve the ultimate breakthrough, Caine pushes his team to move to the next phase â€” using himself as the subject. The test is a success, but when the process can't be reversed and Caine seems doomed to future without flesh, he starts to turn increasingly dangerous.
