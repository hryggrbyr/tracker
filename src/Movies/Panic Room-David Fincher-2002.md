# Panic Room (2002)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/hANYbvfwxmkC9E4yY6YyJxYxlSJ.jpg)

Trapped in their New York brownstone's panic room, a hidden chamber built as a sanctuary in the event of break-ins, newly divorced Meg Altman and her young daughter Sarah play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with three intruders - Burnham, Raoul and Junior - during a brutal home invasion. But the room itself is the focal point because what the intruders really want is inside it.
