# While You Were Sleeping (1995)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qNGO3ETcNwlWqK2kNRpbJSJRlos.jpg)

A transit worker pulls commuter Peter off railway tracks after he's mugged, but—while he's in a coma—his family mistakenly thinks she's Peter's fiancée, and she doesn't correct them. Things get more complicated when she falls for his brother, who's not quite sure that she's who she claims to be.
