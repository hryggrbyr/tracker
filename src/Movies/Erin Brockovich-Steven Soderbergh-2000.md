# Erin Brockovich (2000)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/jEMvWBWVjndZT0vJnLrRWi9ajea.jpg)

A twice-divorced mother of three who sees an injustice, takes on the bad guy and wins -- with a little help from her push-up bra. Erin goes to work for an attorney and comes across medical records describing illnesses clustered in one nearby town. She starts investigating and soon exposes a monumental cover-up.
