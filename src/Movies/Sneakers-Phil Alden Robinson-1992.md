# Sneakers (1992)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/l2pIGwCvpZEpBuMb55YBl6A04Jv.jpg)

When shadowy U.S. intelligence agents blackmail a reformed computer hacker and his eccentric team of security experts into stealing a code-breaking 'black box' from a Soviet-funded genius, they uncover a bigger conspiracy. Now, he and his 'sneakers' must save themselves and the world economy by retrieving the box from their blackmailers.
