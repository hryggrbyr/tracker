# The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qk0iXBQgP6b4xfS2bIUNBSENJAn.jpg)

A series of loosely connected skits that spoof news programs, commercials, porno films, kung-fu films, disaster films, blaxploitation films, spy films, mafia films, and the fear that somebody is watching you on the other side of the TV.
