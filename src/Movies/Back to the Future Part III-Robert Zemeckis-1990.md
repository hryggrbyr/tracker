# Back to the Future Part III (1990)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/crzoVQnMzIrRfHtQw0tLBirNfVg.jpg)

The final installment finds Marty digging the trusty DeLorean out of a mineshaft and looking for Doc in the Wild West of 1885. But when their time machine breaks down, the travelers are stranded in a land of spurs. More problems arise when Doc falls for pretty schoolteacher Clara Clayton, and Marty tangles with Buford Tannen.
