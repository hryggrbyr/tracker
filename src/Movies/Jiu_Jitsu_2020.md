# Jiu Jitsu (2020)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/eLT8Cu357VOwBVTitkmlDEg32Fs.jpg)

Every six years, an ancient order of jiu-jitsu fighters joins forces to battle a vicious race of alien invaders. But when a celebrated war hero goes down in defeat, the fate of the planet and mankind hangs in the balance.
