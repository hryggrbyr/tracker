# Waiting for Guffman (1996)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/zuArI6EBpV6mExrvfnyidoOtzdf.jpg)

Aspiring director Corky St. Clair and the marginally talented amateur cast of his hokey small-town musical production go overboard when they learn that Broadway theater agent Mort Guffman will be in attendance.
