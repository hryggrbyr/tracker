# Jackdaw (2024)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/m3OwT2vQ468E6b05pNCcCKY0Q7u.jpg)

A former motocross champion and army veteran, now caring for his younger brother. Broke, he agrees to do an open water pick up of a mysterious illegal package in the North Sea. A resulting double cross and his brother’s disappearance set him and his old bike on a violent nocturnal odyssey through England’s northern rust belt.
