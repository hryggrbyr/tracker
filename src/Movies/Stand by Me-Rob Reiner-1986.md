# Stand by Me (1986)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/vz0w9BSehcqjDcJOjRaCk7fgJe7.jpg)

After learning that a boy their age has been accidentally killed near their rural homes, four Oregon boys decide to go see the body. On the way, Gordie,  Vern, Chris and Teddy encounter a mean junk man and a marsh full of leeches, as they also learn more about one another and their very different home lives. Just a lark at first, the boys' adventure evolves into a defining event in their lives.
