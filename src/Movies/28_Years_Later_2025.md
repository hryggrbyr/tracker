# 28 Years Later (2025)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/mIg1qCkVxnAlM2TK3RUF0tdEXlE.jpg)

Twenty-eight years since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one member departs on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.
