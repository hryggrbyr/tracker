# Léon: The Professional (1994)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/bxB2q91nKYp8JNzqE7t7TWBVupB.jpg)

Léon, the top hit man in New York, has earned a rep as an effective "cleaner". But when his next-door neighbors are wiped out by a loose-cannon DEA agent, he becomes the unwilling custodian of 12-year-old Mathilda. Before long, Mathilda's thoughts turn to revenge, and she considers following in Léon's footsteps.
