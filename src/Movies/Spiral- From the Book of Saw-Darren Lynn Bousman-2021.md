# Spiral: From the Book of Saw (2021)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/cTvSDfBuXTZTdRCNduGMANd7VEP.jpg)

Working in the shadow of an esteemed police veteran, brash Detective Ezekiel “Zeke” Banks and his rookie partner take charge of a grisly investigation into murders that are eerily reminiscent of the city’s gruesome past.  Unwittingly entrapped in a deepening mystery, Zeke finds himself at the center of the killer’s morbid game.
