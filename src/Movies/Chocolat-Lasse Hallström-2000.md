# Chocolat (2000)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/7sUfspdrvxLMgGkrOq46lPh0Scj.jpg)

A mother and daughter move to a small French town where they open a chocolate shop. The town, religious and morally strict, is against them, as they represent free-thinking and indulgence. When a group of gypsies arrive by riverboat, the Mayor's prejudices lead to a crisis.
