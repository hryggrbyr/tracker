# Coraline (2009)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/4jeFXQYytChdZYE9JYO7Un87IlW.jpg)

Wandering her rambling old house in her boring new town, 11-year-old Coraline discovers a hidden door to a strangely idealized version of her life. In order to stay in the fantasy, she must make a frighteningly real sacrifice.
