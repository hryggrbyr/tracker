# Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/cMQ2lNd7sBe6PCf6zF5QxrKzbRG.jpg)

Cheese-loving eccentric Wallace and his cunning canine pal, Gromit, investigate a mystery in Nick Park's animated adventure, in which the lovable inventor and his intrepid pup run a business ridding the town of garden pests. Using only humane methods that turn their home into a halfway house for evicted vermin, the pair stumble upon a mystery involving a voracious vegetarian monster that threatens to ruin the annual veggie-growing contest.
