# A Cock and Bull Story (2005)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/g14QNhGkWLviBr18nCGDB1U8w8f.jpg)

Steve Coogan, an arrogant actor with low self-esteem and a complicated love life, is playing the eponymous role in an adaptation of "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman" being filmed at a stately home. He constantly spars with actor Rob Brydon, who is playing Uncle Toby and believes his role to be of equal importance to Coogan's.
