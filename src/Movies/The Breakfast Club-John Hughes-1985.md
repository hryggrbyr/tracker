# The Breakfast Club (1985)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wM9ErA8UVdcce5P4oefQinN8VVV.jpg)

Five high school students from different walks of life endure a Saturday detention under a power-hungry principal. The disparate group includes rebel John, princess Claire, outcast Allison, brainy Brian and Andrew, the jock. Each has a chance to tell his or her story, making the others see them a little differently -- and when the day ends, they question whether school will ever be the same.
