# The Elephant Man (1980)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/u0wpPYjuSt8DIe1Y3Vapnh8jcKE.jpg)

A Victorian surgeon rescues a heavily disfigured man being mistreated by his "owner" as a side-show freak. Behind his monstrous fa√ßade, there is revealed a person of great intelligence and sensitivity. Based on the true story of Joseph Merrick (called John Merrick in the film), a severely deformed man in 19th century London.
