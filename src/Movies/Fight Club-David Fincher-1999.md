# Fight Club (1999)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/jSziioSwPVrOy9Yow3XhWIBDjq1.jpg)

A ticking-time-bomb insomniac and a slippery soap salesman channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground "fight clubs" forming in every town, until an eccentric gets in the way and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion.
