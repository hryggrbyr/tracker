![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/oAFPCDSU9bOzl4WDCkakeUyobDD.jpg)

Sir David Attenborough investigates the discovery of a 200 million year old Ichthyosaur on the Jurassic Coast in southern England. Using state of the art technology and CGI David brings the story of the fossilised ichthyosaur out of the rock and shows us what this creature was really like as it lived during the Jurassic time period.
