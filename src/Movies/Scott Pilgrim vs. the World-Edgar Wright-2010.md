# Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/g5IoYeudx9XBEfwNL0fHvSckLBz.jpg)

As bass guitarist for a garage-rock band, Scott Pilgrim has never had trouble getting a girlfriend; usually, the problem is getting rid of them. But when Ramona Flowers skates into his heart, he finds she has the most troublesome baggage of all: an army of ex-boyfriends who will stop at nothing to eliminate him from her list of suitors.
