# Mad Max 2 (1981)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/l1KVEhkGDpWRzQ0VqIhZqDDuOim.jpg)

Max Rockatansky returns as the heroic loner who drives the dusty roads of a postapocalyptic Australian Outback in an unending search for gasoline. Arrayed against him and the other scraggly defendants of a fuel-depot encampment are the bizarre warriors commanded by the charismatic Lord Humungus, a violent leader whose scruples are as barren as the surrounding landscape.
