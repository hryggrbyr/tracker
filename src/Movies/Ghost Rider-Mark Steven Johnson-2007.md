# Ghost Rider (2007)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/d9Oan9XJJ6gRJa64Ifsgp1sXbC4.jpg)

In order to save his dying father, young stunt cyclist Johnny Blaze sells his soul to Mephistopheles and sadly parts from the pure-hearted Roxanne Simpson, the love of his life. Years later, Johnny's path crosses again with Roxanne, now a go-getting reporter, and also with Mephistopheles, who offers to release Johnny's soul if Johnny becomes the fabled, fiery 'Ghost Rider'.
