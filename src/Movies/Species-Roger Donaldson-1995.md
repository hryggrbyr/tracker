# Species (1995)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/cT5wdyo8kT7dycqjrolJ2sHWkFx.jpg)

In 1993, the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence Project receives a transmission detailing an alien DNA structure, along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. The result is Sil, a sensual but deadly creature who can change from a beautiful woman to an armour-plated killing machine in the blink of an eye.
