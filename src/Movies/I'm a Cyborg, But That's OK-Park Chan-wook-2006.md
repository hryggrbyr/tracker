# I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK (2006)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/x48ecVD1HbfQh3KZeK6LwRgVrOl.jpg)

Young-goon, mentally deranged and frequently electro-charging herself with a transistor radio, has been admitted into a mental institution. Firmly believing herself to be a cyborg, she refuses to consume like a human being. Il-soon is another patient, who catches the eye of Young-goon and soon becomes a close friend. Il-soon is now confronted with the biggest task: to cure Young-goon's mental problem and have her eat real food.
