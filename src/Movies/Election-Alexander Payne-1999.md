# Election (1999)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5gPOFU6IPvDrx50XaPCK4twNw79.jpg)

Tracy Flick is running unopposed for this yearâ€™s high school student election. But Jim McAllister has a different plan. Partly to establish a more democratic election, and partly to satisfy some deep personal anger toward Tracy, Jim talks football player Paul Metzler to run for president as well.
