# Room on the Broom (2012)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9qAL19JR0oJ7ZlVpUE1Os2P6XXp.jpg)

Animated film based on the wonderful children's picture book written by Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler.  The story of a kind witch who invites a surprising collection of animals to join her on her broom, much to the frustration of her cat. The gang ultimately saves the witch from a fearsome dragon, and in gratitude she rewards them with a magnificent new broom which has room for everyone.  A magical tale about friendship and family from Magic Light Pictures, the producers of the hugely successful The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child.
