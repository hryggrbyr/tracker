# Hannibal Rising (2007)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/7FTDMQoac0uqJUquZk4KenDzLMZ.jpg)

The story of the early, murderous roots of the cannibalistic killer, Hannibal Lecter â€“ from his hard-scrabble Lithuanian childhood, where he witnesses the repulsive lengths to which hungry soldiers will go to satiate themselves, through his sojourn in France, where as a medical student he hones his appetite for the kill.
