# Memento (2000)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/fKTPH2WvH8nHTXeBYBVhawtRqtR.jpg)

Leonard Shelby is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife's killer, however, is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of short-term memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going, or why.
