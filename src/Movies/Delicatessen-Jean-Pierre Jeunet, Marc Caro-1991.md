![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/gNtOgQHxE5B8e08zuNRAdDpmK5Z.jpg)

In a post-apocalyptic world, the residents of an apartment above the butcher shop receive an occasional delicacy of meat, something that is in low supply. A young man new in town falls in love with the butcher's daughter, which causes conflicts in her family, who need the young man for other business-related purposes.
