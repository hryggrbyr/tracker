# Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl (2024)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/jUWFSBxTOiCinPdTOh3IDUXVemZ.jpg)

Gromit’s concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified, when Wallace invents a “smart” gnome that seems to develop a mind of its own. When it emerges that a vengeful figure from the past might be masterminding things, it falls to Gromit to battle sinister forces and save his master… or Wallace may never be able to invent again!
