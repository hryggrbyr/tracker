# The Producers (1968)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5TYUsAygWKtufAC78ep2AiohEiR.jpg)

Broadway producer Max Bialystock and his accountant, Leo Bloom, plan to make money by charming wealthy old biddies to invest in a production many times over the actual cost, and then put on a sure-fire flop, so nobody will ask for their money back â€“ and what can be a more certain flop than a tasteless musical celebrating Hitler.
