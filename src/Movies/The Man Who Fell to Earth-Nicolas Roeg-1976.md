Thomas Jerome Newton is an alien who has come to Earth in search of water to save his home planet. Aided by lawyer Oliver Farnsworth, Thomas uses his knowledge of advanced technology to create profitable inventions.

Just as he is ready to leave Earth, Thomas is intercepted by the U.S. government, and his entire plan is threatened.
