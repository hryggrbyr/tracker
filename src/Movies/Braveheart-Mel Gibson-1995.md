# Braveheart (1995)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/or1gBugydmjToAEq7OZY0owwFk.jpg)

Enraged at the slaughter of Murron, his new bride and childhood love, Scottish warrior William Wallace slays a platoon of the local English lord's soldiers. This leads the village to revolt and, eventually, the entire country to rise up against English rule.
