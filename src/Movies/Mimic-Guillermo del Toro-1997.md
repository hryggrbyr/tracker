# Mimic (1997)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ieRRo78f8JzEKxfiCKqJyFg6l8o.jpg)

A disease carried by common cockroaches is killing Manhattan children. In an effort to stop the epidemic an entomologist, Susan Tyler, creates a mutant breed of insect that secretes a fluid to kill the roaches. This mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation, but three years later Susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into a large, gruesome monster that can mimic human form.
