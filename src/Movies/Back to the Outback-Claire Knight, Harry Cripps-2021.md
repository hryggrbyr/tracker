# Back to the Outback (2021)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/jbAUTO7qFN8XFG2LM3bz30vzGFJ.jpg)

Tired of being locked in a reptile house where humans gawk at them like they are monsters, a ragtag group of Australia’s deadliest creatures plot an escape from their zoo to the Outback, a place where they’ll fit in without being judged.
