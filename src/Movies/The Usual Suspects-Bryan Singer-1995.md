# The Usual Suspects (1995)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/99X2SgyFunJFXGAYnDv3sb9pnUD.jpg)

Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor â€“ leaving few survivors. Verbal lures his interrogators with an incredible story of the crime lord's almost supernatural prowess.
