![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qIegUGJqyMMCRjkKV1s7A9MqdJ8.jpg)

Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives.
