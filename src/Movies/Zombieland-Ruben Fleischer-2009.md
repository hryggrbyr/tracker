# Zombieland (2009)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/dUkAmAyPVqubSBNRjRqCgHggZcK.jpg)

Columbus has made a habit of running from what scares him. Tallahassee doesn't have fears. If he did, he'd kick their ever-living ass. In a world overrun by zombies, these two are perfectly evolved survivors. But now, they're about to stare down the most terrifying prospect of all: each other.
