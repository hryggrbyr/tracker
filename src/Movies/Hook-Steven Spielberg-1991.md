# Hook (1991)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/a6rB1lGXoGms7gWxRfJneQmAjNV.jpg)

The boy who wasn't supposed to grow up—Peter Pan—does just that, becoming a soulless corporate lawyer whose workaholism could cost him his wife and kids. During his trip to see Granny Wendy in London, the vengeful Capt. Hook kidnaps Peter's kids and forces Peter to return to Neverland.
