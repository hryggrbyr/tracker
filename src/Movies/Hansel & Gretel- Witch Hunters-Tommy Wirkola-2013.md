![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/j343Rpj3WeNvP0SV80zveve70io.jpg)

After getting a taste for blood as children, Hansel and Gretel have become the ultimate vigilantes, hell-bent on retribution. Now, unbeknownst to them, Hansel and Gretel have become the hunted, and must face an evil far greater than witches... their past.
