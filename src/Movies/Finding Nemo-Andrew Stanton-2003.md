# Finding Nemo (2003)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/eHuGQ10FUzK1mdOY69wF5pGgEf5.jpg)

Nemo, an adventurous young clownfish, is unexpectedly taken from his Great Barrier Reef home to a dentist's office aquarium. It's up to his worrisome father Marlin and a friendly but forgetful fish Dory to bring Nemo home -- meeting vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish, hungry seagulls, and more along the way.
