# Parenthood (1989)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/e51tNNQBJpJi9xkyuj0QFhyBcz7.jpg)

The story of the Buckman family and friends, attempting to bring up their children. They suffer/enjoy all the events that occur: estranged relatives, the 'black sheep' of the family, the eccentrics, the skeletons in the closet, and the rebellious teenagers.
