# Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/7lQ0MSNQqBTYpXTTZL82u1n95Z3.jpg)

Hitman Martin Blank becomes a moving target after he rebuffs a fellow assassin's invitation to form a union. On the advice of his quirky assistant and neurotic psychiatrist, Martin begrudgingly heads out to Grosse Pointe, Michigan for his ten-year high school reunion, where he soon comes across the woman he jilted on prom night.
