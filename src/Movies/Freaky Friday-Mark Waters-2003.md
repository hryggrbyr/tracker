# Freaky Friday (2003)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ipKcZ4Up7dp18XpsfYUc9NKZy3g.jpg)

Mother and daughter bicker over everything -- what Anna wears, whom she likes and what she wants to do when she's older. In turn, Anna detests Tess's fianc√©. When a magical fortune cookie switches their personalities, they each get a peek at how the other person feels, thinks and lives.
