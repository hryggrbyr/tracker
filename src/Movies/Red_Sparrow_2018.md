Prima ballerina Dominika Egorova faces a bleak and uncertain future after she suffers an injury that ends her career. She soon turns to Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people to use their minds and bodies as weapons.

As she comes to terms with her new abilities, she meets a CIA agent who tries to convince her that he is the only person she can trust.
