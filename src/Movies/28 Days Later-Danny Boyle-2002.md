# 28 Days Later (2002)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/sQckQRt17VaWbo39GIu0TMOiszq.jpg)

Twenty-eight days after a killer virus was accidentally unleashed from a British research facility, a small group of London survivors are caught in a desperate struggle to protect themselves from the infected. Carried by animals and humans, the virus turns those it infects into homicidal maniacs -- and it's absolutely impossible to contain.
