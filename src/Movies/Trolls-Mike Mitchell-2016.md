# Trolls (2016)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9VlK2j0THZWzhQPq0W3Oc0IIdBB.jpg)

After the monstrous Bergens invade Troll Village, Princess Poppy, the happiest Troll ever born, and overly-cautious, curmudgeonly outcast Branch set off on a journey to rescue her friends. Their mission is full of adventure and mishaps, as this mismatched duo try to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.
