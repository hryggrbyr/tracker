# Primal Fear (1996)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qJf2TzE8nRTFbFMPJNW6c8mI0KU.jpg)

An arrogant, high-powered attorney takes on the case of a poor altar boy found running away from the scene of the grisly murder of the bishop who has taken him in. The case gets a lot more complex when the accused reveals that there may or may not have been a third person in the room.
