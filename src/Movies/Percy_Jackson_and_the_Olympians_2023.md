# Percy Jackson and the Olympians (2023)

![](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/c9loCTYWZpzYBTJBvE3DtRw4DBb.jpg)

Percy Jackson is on a dangerous quest. Outrunning monsters and outwitting gods, he must journey across America to return Zeus's master bolt and stop an all-out war. With the help of his friends Annabeth and Grover, Percy's journey will lead him closer to the answers he seeks: how to fit into a world where he feels out of place, and who he's destined to be.
